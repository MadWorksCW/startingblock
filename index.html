        <h2>An Entrepreneurial Hub and Ecosystem Helping Madison’s Entrepreneurs Succeed</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Strong economies depend</b> on vibrant entrepreneurial
      and startup communities. According to the Kauffman
      Foundation, startups are responsible for all net new job growth
      nationwide, adding three million new jobs each year.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>The region has many of the components to grow as a startup
      hotspot</b> &mdash; with Madison’s world-class research university and
      dynamic technical college, an educated and talented workforce,
      and high quality of life. Madison already boasts a growing
      number of seasoned as well as first-time entrepreneurs creating
      jobs in high-growth industries such as technology, biotech and
      healthcare; and has a maturing entrepreneurial community that
      includes the peer-to-peer networking group of Capital
      Entrepreneurs; the prototyping hackerspace of Sector67; and the
      successful accelerator of gener8tor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Madison also has a long history of growing successful
      economic and entrepreneurial infrastructure.</b> For example, the
      the MGE Innovation Center incubator created in the University
      Research Park in 1989 was a revolutionary project with a
      tremendous impact on the growth of biotech and IT companies.
      More recently, a grant to the UW from the Kaufmann Foundation
      in 2007 helped play a role in fostering an environment that led to
      the inception of a number of initiatives which are still helping
      shape the local entrepreneurial ecosystem. These include
      Capital Entrepreneurs, the Forward Technology Festival, MERLIN
      Mentors and a host of other groups and startup companies.
    </p>
    <p>  
      <b>What Madison needs next</b> is to bring its existing components
      together and build a strong, interconnected entrepreneurial
      ecosystem so that our startups can grow faster, better and
      stronger. Cities with successful entrepreneurial hubs, such as
      San Francisco, Boston and Chicago as well as smaller cities like
      Boulder and Austin, have found that entrepreneurs need places
      to gather, collaborate and support each other as well as to
      access funders, advisors and educational programming.
      Building a place with a critical mass of entrepreneurial creativity
      and resources will support a pipeline of startups, accelerate job
      creation and help Madison retain talent and businesses.
